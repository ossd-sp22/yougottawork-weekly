---

For the last week of the semester, we finished final project presentations.

# Final Presentation - Day 2 and Day 3

I enjoyed this week hearing from other groups about their unique experience in different open source projects all over the world. I love how each of us have different
responsibility, meaning, and personal emotional connection. It's what makes this class unique and joyful. 

Overall, I felt very relatable to other Oppia groups. They were experiencing similar difficulties and I definitely agreed with most of the things they pointed out. There
are a few annoying things about Oppia, but in general, it's a wonderful open source project to contribute to. I would, like I said in presentation, definitely pick Oppia again.

# Open Source Software Development

This class gave me a whole different view about contributions, obviously in a very good way! I enjoyed this class a lot, probably one of the best classes I have taken!
I loved the class environment (roughly 30 people only), loved the interactions and everything. I can't believe it's already end of the semester. Time really flies. I
genuinely hope everyone in this class the best, I will miss this class a lot, and thank you professor Joanna for everything. Have a great rest of 2022 everyone.
