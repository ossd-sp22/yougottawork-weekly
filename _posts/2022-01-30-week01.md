# Open Source? 

On the first week of the class, I was able to learn about what Open Source really is and how Open Source projects have been around me in everyday life. 
Before the lecture, I simply thought Open Source means when a project makes itself public so that everyone can see and utilize it. 
For example, when I create a program, I thought implementing Java or C libraries is an example of using an open source.
But I learned it was a lot more than that; by making a project (and also anything other than project) an open source, everyone who finds and understands the project can contribute to it, and therefore the project can be developed and improved in much faster and diverse way. Furthermore, just making its source code available doesn't mean that the project is open source; there must be a valid license that meets certain requirements, and when it does, the project can be finally considered open source.
Although there are some potential negative side of Open Source, I believe it's wonderful; it's absolutely amazing to imagine how everyone in different parts of the world can work on one project together and share ideas. 

# Open Source vs Closed Source

There are certainly many advantages of making a project open source. First, since everyone can contribute to the project, we will be able to collect significantly diverse viewpoints about the project, which will be a huge benefit to have an insight about the project that we couldn't think of if we worked on the project alone. I believe this is the most significant of advantage of open source project; we all have different ideas about things around us and there must be people that have great ideas that we couldn't think of at that moment. Secondly, open source project can reduce time and energy by significant means compared to closed source when it comes to creating a new project. By referring to the code from open source projects, the base of new projects can be done in a fraction of time.

Then why don't all people make their projects open source? It's because there are some potential problems with open source and there are some advantages of closed source projects. As an opposite of an open source, closed source refers to the projects that don't make their source code public or puts restriction on the public source code in terms of distribution and ownership. A closed source can be beneficial when the owner of the project wants to keep it for themselves and don't want other people to see and use their code. Therefore a closed source can have an advantage when the owner wants to earn profit from their project. Another advantage of closed source can be that since only the original members of the project will be able to work on it, there will be a lot less conflict and disturbance when implementing new features and such. The potential problems with open source are the reason why people sometimes prefer closed source over open source; because everyone is a contributor of the project and it's mostly not possible to do a meeting with all the contributors over the world, it could be very chaotic when deciding which new features should be approved and which should be implemented for public/customer use. Another problem is that we can't make sure that every contributor of the project is validated and is therefore safe; there might be someone (especially possibly from a competing company) who desires to intentionally damage the project.

Although there are certianly some possible problems with open source, it's undeniable that open source has a significant advantage that the society as a whole can benefit from.
