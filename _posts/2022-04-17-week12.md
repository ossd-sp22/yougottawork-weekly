This week, the class learned about the relationship between industries and open source, and we continued working on our group projects.

# Industries and open source

# Oppia

This week, Neev had to leave for a conference in California, so Blake and I focused on the project.

It was a rough week. I finished a rough draft of schemas for Suggestion Email Handler and Instant Feedback Message Email Handler. It took me a long time to understand
how to write schemas; I had to read a lot of examples to create one by myself. After finishing them, we used Blake's macbook
to make a pull request to the repository. Creating PR was another long, difficult journey. After adding the schemas into the file, when
Blake ran the program, we had a lot of errors. We took 1 hour to try to solve the problem, but none of the solutions worked. We kept quesetioning:
"we just simply added schema to the code and changed nothing else, there must not be any errors". Then we realized all of the errors were
linting issues; the rules with structure (spaces, tabs, etc) of the writing is strict with Oppia, and not following them
leads to a run error. So we fixed the errors easily after realizing what's wrong. We're now waiting for the feedback
on our schmas from the main contributors.

After making the PR, Blake and I started looking for more other issues to work on. We found two issues and commented on them
for an assignment. The main contributor for the first issue is apparently inactive, but Blake got instantly assigned to the second 
issue right after he commented. We worked on the second issue together, and the problem was Blake's VSCode had an
auto-indent-when-saving option. We took the whole class time to figure out how to turn it off. It was extremely simple, but
we couldn't find the button for a long time. But anyways, we solved the problem and once Blake fixes the errors he will create a PR.

I had a meeting with Sean (main contributor) about non-coding contributions. Sean gave me an explanation of each group/responsibility in math lesson team, and asked me
which group I wish to join. Sean invited me to the weekly Math Lesson Team meeting on Tuesdays, so I'll join the first meeting on the 19th. While waiting, I'll keep working
on the coding contributions with Blake.
